# 6-DOF Missile Simulation in C++

## Project Overview

This project is a basic 6-DOF (Six Degrees of Freedom) missile simulation written in C++. It models the movement of a missile in 3D space, incorporating fundamental aerodynamic forces and simple control logic. This simulation is designed to help you gain hands-on experience with C++ programming and deepen your understanding of missile dynamics and 6-DOF simulations.
